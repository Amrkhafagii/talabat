# Admin QA – Phase 7

## Mid-sprint pass
- [ ] Orders triage: filter chips show correct subsets; reroute/refund actions update Supabase + analytics.
- [ ] Payouts queue: approve/reject flows, clipboard export continues to work.
- [ ] Reviews: approve/reject decisions reflect immediately, WebView previews load (where applicable).
- [ ] Feature flags: toggle known keys and confirm apps respond (beta banner, incident reminder, etc.).

## Pre-release pass
- [ ] Regression on legacy dashboard metrics after new navigation additions.
- [ ] Verify Supabase dashboards show `admin_order_action`, `admin_payout_reviewed`, and `feature_flag_changed` at least once.
- [ ] Link QA notes to Linear/Notion tickets for final go/no-go meeting.
