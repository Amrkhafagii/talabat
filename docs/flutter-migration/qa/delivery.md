# Delivery QA – Phase 7

## Mid-sprint pass
- [ ] Earnings page: validate weekly totals match legacy app; ledger entries sorted by date.
- [ ] History list: completed jobs list matches staging data, statuses reflect SLA breaches.
- [ ] Wallet: payout proof resubmission flow works, telemetry `driver_payout_requested` captured.
- [ ] Incident sheet: submit while offline, ensure queue counter increments; return online and verify flush.

## Pre-release pass
- [ ] Profile page: toggle availability, upload documents, confirm Supabase records update.
- [ ] Feedback form: slider + notes persist and analytics `delivery_feedback_submitted` appears.
- [ ] End-to-end: navigation entry points from dashboard link to all new pages without blocking tasks.
