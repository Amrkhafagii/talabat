# Restaurant QA – Phase 7

## Mid-sprint pass
- [ ] Performance page: KPI cards render data from staging RPCs; trend chart updates when date range changes.
- [ ] Category manager: reorder categories via drag, create/delete, confirm Supabase order persists.
- [ ] Order detail: simulate hold/capture actions; verify analytics `restaurant_order_action` logged.
- [ ] Settings: edit hours for multiple days, update GPS pin, invite staff via email.

## Pre-release pass
- [ ] Wallet tab: manual payout proof submission, KYC upload, documents timeline.
- [ ] Telemetry dashboards show `restaurant_settings_saved` and `restaurant_metrics_viewed` events after walkthrough.
- [ ] Regression: menu editor + existing orders unaffected after navigation to new pages.
